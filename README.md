### Hi there 👋
I am Sekwang Lee, an undergraduate student at POSTECH, department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am currently deeply interested in **3D computer vision, computer graphics, and multimodal learning** and continuously gaining research experience in this field. I am not limited to this specific area and have a broad interest in various fields of computer science and engineering, including AI.

I don't want to give up any value easily. I believe that exploring diverse values, including not only professional knowledge in the field of CSE but also deep reflection on humanities, leadership, and social issues, can exponentially enhance the potential of an engineer. I aspire to grow into an **engineering-based generalist**, capable of achieving goals in any environment.

This is my personal motto:<br/>
***“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”*** - Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning
